    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hey, I’m <strong>Jordan Unzaga</strong> — a Computer Science major at Montana State University who loves building practical, well-designed software.
        I focus on backend systems, web development, and creative technical projects ranging from full-stack apps to small indie games.
        My goal is to design tools that are both efficient and enjoyable to use.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve worked with technologies like Java, SQL, PHP, and JavaScript while maintaining a strong focus on clean structure and usability.
        I enjoy projects that challenge both logic and creativity — like writing graph algorithms one day and pixel art interfaces the next.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:2rem;">
        When I’m not coding, I’m usually at the gym, cooking, or working on creative side projects like music playlists and game design.
        I love to work with my hands, whether is shaping wood, painting, or playing video games.
        You can check out my work through the <a href="projects.html" style="color:#006fff; text-decoration:none;">Projects</a> page.
